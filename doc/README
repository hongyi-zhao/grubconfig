Based on the discussion with the author of refind, I deduced the following method which
combining the usage of grub2 and refind-cd:

1. Make the following stuff according the notes there:
   
   EFI/grub-mkstandalone/

2. Mount the refind-cd and then copy its EFI sub-directory onto the second-to-last partition formated with fat32. 
   For the purpose of fault tolerance, also dd a copy of the refind-flashdrive version onto 
   the last partition of the same harddisk as following.
   
   sudo ddrescue -fy refind-flashdrive-0.12.0.img /dev/xxxn #(say, sdb7)
    
   But only using the refind-flashdrive version as above, it can't found the boot loaders on the harddisks automatically.  


With the above method, there is no need to creating nvram entries with efibootmgr and   
set boot/esp flag for the efi partitions.  Furthermore, only the refind-cd's EFI sub-directory need to be put on a 
fat32 root partition, all other stuff can use more mordern file systems, say ext4.


    
Compile and install using source code:

sudo apt-get build-dep gnu-efi
make -j24

For installation:
$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi
$ sudo ./refind-install 

After installation, it will give some instructions on doing some adjustments.

According the directory structure of the refind-cd's EFI sub-directory to rename corresponding files.
