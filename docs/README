Based on the discussion with the author of refind, I deduced the following method which
combining the usage of grub2 and refind-cd:

1. Make the following stuff according the notes there:
   
   EFI/grub-mkstandalone/

2. Mount the refind-cd and then copy the EFI folder onto a fat32 root partition. 
   
   rEFInd_0.11.5 works with this mothod, but 0.12.0 failed to load the oses menu entries.


Both 0.12.0/0.11.5 can compile from source:

but 0.12.0 failed to load the oses menu entries, there is nothing to show. and for 0.11.5,
I failed to figure out how to config the oses menues for different oses.  It cannot automatically detect the 
oses. While the refind-cd based method can automatically detect the oses. 

 


sudo apt-get build-dep gnu-efi
$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi
make -j24
werner@ubuntu-01:~/refind-0.11.5$ sudo ./refind-install 

After installation, it will give some instructions on doing some adjustments.

According the directory structure of the refind-cd's EFI to rename corresponding files.

   
3. Optionally, for the fallback purpose, copy the subfolder refind under refind-bin to the EFI/ directory, i.e.,
   the same directory which the grub-mkstandalone resides.
 
   
All things are done!

With the above method, there is no need to creating nvram entries with efibootmgr and   
set boot/esp flag on the efi partitions.  Furthermore, only the refind-cd's content need to be put on a 
fat32 root partition, all other stuff can use more mordern file systems, say ext4.
