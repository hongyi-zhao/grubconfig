Based on the discussion with the author of refind, I deduced the following method which
combining the usage of grub2 and refind-cd:

1. Make the following stuff according the notes there:
   
   EFI/grub-mkstandalone/

2. Mount the refind-cd and then put it's content on a fat32 root partition. 
   This method is workable for both usb and hd. 
   You can do this by using the rsync as follows:
   
   rsync -av /media/werner/rEFInd_0.11.4/ /path/to/fat32/root/partition
   
3. Optionally, for the fallback purpose, copy the subfolder refind under refind-bin to the EFI/ directory, i.e.,
   the same directory which the grub-mkstandalone resides.
 
   
All things are done!

With the above method, there is no need to creating nvram entries with efibootmgr and   
set boot/esp flag on the efi partitions.  Furthermore, only the refind-cd's content need to be put on a 
fat32 root partition, all other stuff can use more mordern file systems, say ext4.
